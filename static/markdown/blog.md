Woohoo! Project has been started

### Why Vue and Nuxt
Without [rehashing too much](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html) of the obvious, I found that Vue's lightweight and approachable nature to be perfect for revamping my site. It is also a framework I've been meaning to learn, having had some previous experience with React and AngularJS. 

With Nuxt, its clear file structure really helps speed up getting stated on a Vue project. The ability for it to statically generate a site right out of the box is also a super useful bonus.

### ESLint
Ran into some ESLint issues with my VSCode setup, fix was to use workspace settings instead of setting a global editor.formatOnSave. [Link to article](https://medium.com/@gogl.alex/how-to-properly-set-up-eslint-with-prettier-for-vue-or-nuxt-in-vscode-e42532099a9c)

### Markdown
For simplicity in writing and displaying this blog, I wanted to use Markdown and [came across this handy example](https://github.com/davidroyer/nuxt-markdown-example).

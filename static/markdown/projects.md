##### <a href="https://smash.org.au/" target="_blank">SMASH! Anime Convention - Sydney Manga & Anime Show</a>

I help out on the ticket payment gateway of an annual Sydney manga and anime convention. This project is entirely volunteer driven and is where we experiment with the latest techniques and libraries to create a platform that is stable and easy to maintain.

Tech: Typescript, React, Redux

##### <a href="https://github.com/kyymichelle/kyymichelle.github.io/tree/dev" target="_blank">https://kyymichelle.github.io!</a>

I revamped this website so that it was easier to update and so that it moved away from being a series static HTML templates. The main purpose of this project was to try out Vue and Nuxt, as well as demonstrate a bit of design. Read more about how this site was made in my [blog post](/blog).

Tech: Vue, Nuxt

##### <a href="https://github.com/kyymichelle/country-guess-game" target="_blank">Country guess game (WIP)</a>

This is the current project I'm tinkering away on - it's a simple string guessing game where users can guess the name of a country based on given clues. The primary goal of doing this project is to learn how to use Typescript and to familiarise myself with structuring an application with Redux and [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). Whilst the base of this game is simple, it's an extensible idea where I plan to add new features such as game difficulty levels and score tracking.

Tech: Typescript, React, Redux, GraphQL

## Game Projects

Here are a few small VanillaJS game projects I've worked on.

A group project with Robert Anderson-Butterworth, Ryan Salinas and Joseph Fenech. This is a simple tile-based role playing game that features randomly generated terrain and monsters, path finding, combat, items and character progression.

##### Cells
In this game, players control a blue cell travelling along the blood stream. It can eat any black cell smaller than itself, but at the same time must dodge any that are larger.

##### Influence
A group project with Belinda Yuqi Ding and Justine Chau. Influence is a two player game where players fire coloured orbs at each other. Players lose their outer layer when they come into contact with an orb of the same colour, and lose the game when all their layers are missing.

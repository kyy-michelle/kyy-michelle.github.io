A group project with Robert Anderson-Butterworth, Ryan Salinas and Joseph Fenech. This is a simple tile-based role playing game that features randomly generated terrain and monsters, path finding, combat, items and character progression.

#### Cells
In this game, players control a blue cell travelling along the blood stream. It can eat any black cell smaller than itself, but at the same time must dodge any that are larger.

#### Influence
A group project with Belinda Yuqi Ding and Justine Chau. Influence is a two player game where players fire coloured orbs at each other. Players lose their outer layer when they come into contact with an orb of the same colour, and lose the game when all their layers are missing.

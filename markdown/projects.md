##### [Country guess game (WIP)](https://github.com/kyymichelle/country-guess-game)

This is the current project I'm tinkering away on - it's a simple string guessing game where users can guess the name of a country based on given clues. The primary goal of doing this project is to learn how to use Typescript and to familiarise myself with structuring an application with Redux and [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). Along the way, I am also using GraphQL APIs and writing tests using Jest with Enzyme.

Whilst the base of this game is simple, it is a very extensible idea where new features - such as clue difficulty levels and score tracking - can be added.

Recently I revamped this website such that it was more mobile friendly and moved away from using pure static HTML templates. The main purpose of this project was to try out Vue and Nuxt, as well as to showcase a bit of design. The codebase for this lovely little website is in [this repo](https://github.com/kyymichelle/kyymichelle.github.io/tree/dev), under the `dev` branch.

## Game Projects

Here are a few small VanillaJS game projects I've worked on.

In this game, players control a blue cell travelling along the blood stream. It can eat any black cell smaller than itself, but at the same time must dodge any that are larger.

##### Influence
A group project with Belinda Yuqi Ding and Justine Chau. Influence is a two player game where players fire coloured orbs at each other. Players lose their outer layer when they come into contact with an orb of the same colour, and lose the game when all their layers are missing.

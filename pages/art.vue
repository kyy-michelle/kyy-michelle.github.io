      A four-piece wood and layered cardboard assemblage measuring
      2.68x1.24x0.21m in total. This is a project I had worked on over a year,
      the final artist statement is below.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="px-3">
      Once meaning 'out' or 'out of' (such as with evoke, eject and effuse), the
      prefix 'e-' is now also understood to mean 'electronic' as with eBook,
      eCommerce and email. Through the assemblage of recycled and discarded
      materials, namely timber and corrugated cardboard, this piece looks at the
      continually influenced and shaped by the Information Age.

      Once meaning 'out' or 'out of' (such as with evoke, eject and effuse), the
      prefix 'e-' is now also understood to mean 'electronic' as with eBook,
      eCommerce and email. Through the assemblage of recycled and discarded
      materials, namely timber and corrugated cardboard, this piece looks at the
      motif of language as a process of transformation, as the human race is
      continually influenced and shaped by the Information Age.
